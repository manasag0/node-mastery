The problem with storing like the way we see above is not the correct way of storing enterprise data

To addres this problem, scientists, mathematicians and engineers brainstormed and came up with an idea 
of storing data in tables

They called this structured query language or SQL.  So, SQL is a database language

MySQL, postgreSQL, oracle, MSSql



A table has rows and columns
intersection fo row and column is a cell. A cell will hold data or information

There is this company which has multiple offices in multiple locations. 
In each office, we have different departments
In each department, we have many employees
Each employee had Id, and we have some info about him
We manintain salary register
We have customers

we will create tables for
company - name, ceo, revenue, employee strength
office
department
employee  - id, name, age, department, designation, salary
customers


Create DB

CREATE DATABASE dbname

CREATE TABLE customers(
    Id INT, 
    FirstName VARCHAR(255),
    LASTNAME VARCHAR(255),
    CITY VARCHAR(255),
    CUSTOMER_SINCE date,
)


INSERT INTO customers (ID, FirstName, LASTNAME, CITY, customer_since)
values('1', 'chakri', 'd', 'Hyderabad', '01-01-2020')


PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY

Table user                               Table post

_id email name password                   _id   userId  title  content

1  abc@gmail.com abc 1234                  2131  1      test    test content
                                           4222  1      test2   test content2


PRIMARY KEY of one table, if it is stored as a column in another table,
we call it FOREIGN KEY                       

In post table, userId is a FOREIGN_KEY


We learnt

what is SQL
what is database
what is a table, row, column
How to create table
how to modify table
data types - INT, VARCHAR, BOOL, date

PRIMARY KEY
composite PRIMARY KEY (combination of 2 or more columns)
FOREIGN KEY

CONSTRAINTS - NOT NULL, UNIQUE

INSERTing data into table
updating data

QUERIES
NESTED QUERIES

SELECT DISTINCT
WHERE
AND, OR, NOT
OPERATORS =, <, > <>, BETWEEN, IN, NOT IN, LIKE

ALIAS

SUM(), MAX(), MIN(), AVG(), COUNT()

JOINS - INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, SELF

JOINS will be on a common column

GROUP BY HAVING
