Generally to login
a user should enter username/email/phone and a password.

Suppose a user is trying to get posts

1st time login
2nd login
3rd time login

So, in summary, It is not good to ask the user or client to login for every API call.
At the same time, we cannot compromise on security


When the user logs in, server will check if the user is valid.
If valid, the server will issue a token.
For all subsequent API calls, the user/client will pass that token with every request.
The server will scan that token and decide to forward that request or deny entry.

A breif history before the use of tokens (May be 20 years ago)

Earlier, servers used to maintain sessions and keep track of who is requesting what.
It means that server used to have a state.
This kind of setup has the server stateful.
These are called stateful web applications or servers.

But, today, with the issuance of tokens, 
our new server will issue a token and does not keep a copy or any info about it.
It does not care for or maintain the state of the client.
So, this kind of server is called stateless server.
Such APIs are called RESTful APIs.
REST - Representational state transfer

The tokens which get exchanged here are called JWT tokens.
JSON web tokens.

JWT is made up of 3 parts.

HEADER, PAYLOAD, SIGNATURE
