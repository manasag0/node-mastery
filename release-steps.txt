There are stages of a product (promotion levels)

1. Development - Developers do the development and test locally. This is dev environment

2. QA (Testing) - Testers need to test. i.e they need to have the application running somewhere.
                  We cant ask them to sit next to us and test in our machine.
                  We need to deploy it somewhere and run it there.
                  Now, we will share the link to QA person and ask him/her to test.
                  For QA, we need to set up things.
                  Eg: We need to create a separate DB for them.
                  This is called QA environment.

3. Staging - staging environment - there may be some other team who will do security checks. they might check for code compliances

4. pre prod (beta)

5. Production - open to public/stakeholders

As a summary, we can see that there are many stages and for each stage, we have environments.

Before going to production,
1. We need to make sure that code is clean with out any connection strings, passwords or secrets
2. We need to setup appropriate environments for each stage.

env files come to our rescue here.
